<b>Directions: </b> The rules for the original game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus). Wumpus Adventure is extremely similar, and can be summarized by the following.

1) Your goal is to find the ancient treasure, and carry it safely to the exit. However, your path through the Wumpus Cave is dark. Only after moving to a new space will the path brighten. The cave is represented by a 10 x 10 grid.

2) There are a number of deadly obstacles in your way. The greatest of which is the fearsome WUMPUS. Landing on the Wumpus results in immediate death. Other obstacles include:
  - <b>Bats</b> that transport you to a random area of the map, and disorient you.
  - <b>Bottomless Pits</b> that cause you to fall to your death.

3) You will be alerted with a message, should an obstacle be nearby (in any of the tiles adjacent of diagonal to you). You will not be told exactly where it is.

<i>Each game randomly generates a new Wumpus Cave. How many times can you retrieve the treasure?</i>
